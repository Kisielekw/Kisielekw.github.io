            Hi my name is Dawid Kisielewski and welcome to my GitHub Pages. 
            Here you can find my projects and more information about me.
            <br>
            I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Hull doing an MEng. 
            I've been programming ever since I was introduced to Scratch by my ICT teacher when I was 9 years old. 
            Obviously, I started off with Scratch moving on to Python and later on to C# and C++ and even dabbled with some rust. 
            I've used tools such as CodeCademy, W3School and GeeksforGeeks to learn fundamentals of other languages such as Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and SQL. 
            Outside of coding, Iâ€™ve also led a computer science club for kids from ages 8 to 13 in which I taught them how to code in Luna using the Roblox game engine.
            <br>
            During my time at university, I've learned a lot and worked on projects on the cutting edge of my skills.
            The first project I worked on during university was a CLI project called KisielLogic in which I created a command line interface in which the user can create, join and interact with logic gates.
            This was just after learning about OOP principles and I wanted to put them to the test.
            I have also participated in game jams and hackathons such as the Three Thing Game Jam and the Global Game Jam.
