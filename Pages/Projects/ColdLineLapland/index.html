        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            ColdLine Lapland is a game created by me and 2 of my team mates for the Thee Thing Game Jam organised by the University of Hull<br>
            In Three Thing Game you recive 3 random workds around one theam and are tasked to create a game involving these words within a weekend
            My team ended up with the words: <b>Carollers</b>, <b>Lights</b>, and <b>Mincepie</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            The game is a twin-stick shooter in which the player shoots carollers using a mincepie shotgun as they try and stop you by singing christmas carols at you.
            <br>
            <br>
            The game was created in Unity and was a great learning experience for me as it was my first time using Unity and C# to create a compleatly playable game. I learned a lot about game development and the process of creating a game in a short amount of time.

        <p>
            The game is inspired by the classic dual shooter game Hotline Miami.
            As you can probably tell we not only copied some of the mechanics but also the name of the game.
            <br>
            In the game the player treverses the map shooting down enemie caroller uisng there trusty mincepie shotgun.
            The carollers will try and shoot you down using their deadly christmas carols.
            At the end of the level the player will find the final boss, a giant bundle of tangled christmas lights which rapidly shoots out bundles of it's self at the player.
            Throughout the level the player will find ammo crates to refill their supply of ammo.
            <br>
            This game loop provides a fast paced game with a lot of action and a lot of fun.
            Due to the time constraints of the game jam we were unable to add a lot of features we wanted to add such as additional levels, but nontheless we are proud of the game we created.
