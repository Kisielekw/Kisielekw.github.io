        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            This is a project I created for my University course in which I had to create a framework to create games using DirectX 11.
            <br>
            At the start of the project during the initialisation method the framework loads all models, textures and shaders that are going to be used in the game.
            <br>
            The framework next reads a scene file that contains all the information about the scene such as the models, textures and shaders that are going to be used in the scene.

        <h1>Features</h1>
        <p>
            The application has a features which are nice:
            <br>
            <br>
            The application has the ability to load in models from a obj file and textures from a dds file. the obj file can contail multiple models. It also has the ability to load in shaders from a fx file which contains a pixel and vertex shader.
            <br>
            The application has a debug window that shows information about the objects adn the lights in the scene. It can also edit this information. The window is made using ImGui.
            <br>
            The scene is created by reading a config file in which each object is listed as well as the lighting information.
