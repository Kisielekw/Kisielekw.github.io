            Hi my name is Dawid Kisielewski and welcome to my GitHub Pages. 
            Here you can find my projects and more information about me.
            <br>
            Im a Computer Science student at the University of Hull doing a BSc. 
            I've been programming ever since I was introduced to Scratch by my ICT teacher when I was 9 years old. 
            Obviously I started off with Scratch moving on to Python and later on to C#. 
            I've used tools such as CodeCademy, W3School and GeeksforGeeks to learn fundamentals of other languages such as Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and SQL. 
            Outside of coding I’ve also led a computer science club for children from ages 8 to 13 in which I taught them how to code in Luna using the Roblox game engine. 
            In the future I’m planning to learn OpenGL and other Graphical APIs and pursue a career as a Graphics Programmer in the games industry.
