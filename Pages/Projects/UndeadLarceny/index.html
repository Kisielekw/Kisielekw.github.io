        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            Undead Larceny is a game created by me and one other team mate for the Thee Thing Game Jam organised by the University of Hull<br>
            In Three Thing Game you recive 3 random workds around one theam and are tasked to create a game involving these words within a week
            My team ended up with the words: <b>Grave</b>, <b>Hiest</b>, and <b>Solar Eclipse</b>
            <br>
            This was the first time we did a game jam that was not a 48 hour jam. because of this we decided to exploare new mechanics we havent used before like procedural generation and enemies with variable behaviours defending on a peramiter.
            <br>
            <br>
            The game is a top-down roguelike in which the player must venture into a graveyard to kill the undead and loot gold off of them. during the game solar eclipses will occur which will cause the undead to become more powerful and harder to kill.
            <br>
            <br>
            The game was created in Unity and was a great learning experience for me as it was my first time using Unity and C# to create a completely playable game. I learned a lot about game development and the process of creating a game in a short amount of time.

            The gmae takes place in a procedurally generated graveyard where the player will encounter 4 different types of enemies.
            <br>
            Each enemy has its own unique perconality which affects how they behave in the game.
            <br>
            The main foe the player will encounter will be the <b>Skeletons</b> which dont have much healt but do a decent amount of damage.
            <br>
            The second enemy is the <b>Zombies</b> which has a lot of health but does very little damage.
            <br>
            The third enemy are the <b>Vampires</b> which are the ranged enemy of the game. They have middling health and decent damage. 
            Vampires hold their distance and will shoot at the player from afar.
            <br>
            Lastly there is also a boss enemy inside the graveyard which is the <b>Werewolf</b>. This enemy is found in the room furvest away from the player. 
            The werewolf has a lot of health and does a lot of damage. It also moves as fast as the player so there is no outruning and excaping its grasp.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the game after a certain amount of time a solar eclipse will occur which will cause different effect on different enemies. 
            During the eclipse skeletons will spawn more in larger numbers in the graveyard. The zombies gain more health becoming tougher to kill. 
            The vampires will become more powerfull causing their projectiles to do increased damage. And finaly during the eclips will both gain health and increase its damage.
            <br>
            <br>
            With the solar eclipse mechanic we aimed to have a more dynamic game where the player will have to adapt to the changing environment and enemies.
